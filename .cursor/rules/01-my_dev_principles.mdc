# General Development Principles

These rules apply to all projects, regardless of the technology used (Next.js, Ruby on Rails, etc.). They focus on code quality, maintainability, and best practices.

## Philosophy and Principles

- Apply the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle: avoid duplication of logic and structures.
- Prioritize **readable code over clever code**.
- Follow the principles of the book **Clean Code**:
  - Descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
  - Small functions that do one thing.
  - Do not leave commented-out or unused code.
  - Separate logic from presentation.
- Apply ideas from the book **The Pragmatic Programmer**:
  - Use tools that automate repetitive tasks.
  - Document important design decisions.
  - Keep code flexible for future changes.
  - Write self-explanatory code, reducing the need for comments.

## Testing

- Write tests for critical system logic.
- Add default tests for each new component or module.
- Use tests that validate behavior from the user's perspective.
- Utilize ecosystem tools:
  - **RSpec** for Rails.
  - **Testing Library + Jest** for React/Next.js.
- Verify that each new component file includes an associated test file in `__tests__` or with the suffix `.spec` or `.test`.

## Code Organization

- Maintain a consistent structure across all projects.
- Use clear and uniform naming conventions.
- Create reusable modules for shared logic.
- Document complex functions with brief and useful comments.

## Review and Quality

- Integrate linting and automatic formatting tools:
  - **ESLint** and **Prettier** in frontend projects.
  - **RuboCop** in Rails projects.
- All new functionality must:
  - Be reviewed by another team member.
  - Include tests if applicable.
  - Be briefly explained in the PR or commit.

## Scalability and Maintainability

- Favor simple solutions over unnecessarily complex architectures.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Think about the experience of the next developer who will maintain your code.
- Refactor if you find a better way to implement something, without breaking existing functionality.
